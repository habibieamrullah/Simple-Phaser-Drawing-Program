# Drawing with Phaser
 How to draw with colorful brushes and adjustable brush sizes with Phaser.
 
With this program you can draw anything using a brush that can be adjusted, its size and its color, completely customize-able.

There is also a button to clear the canvas so you can start over drawing again.

This simple drawing can be useful to you if you want to make an online drawing program for kids. You can modify and tweak it according your need.
